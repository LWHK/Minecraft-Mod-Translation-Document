Most mages will be able to sense these with only a little bit of magical experience, probably mages that are at least level 5.\n\nNext are diamonds.  While not as easy as emeralds, chimerite can be found here by mages with a little bit more experience, above level 10.\n\nLastly is coal.  Chimerite is technically there in trace elements, but it takes a finely tuned magical mind to pick up the traces that are large enough to be useable.  I would say no mage under level 20 would see it.\n\nOn that point, I should note that the chimerite is also often destroyed as part of the mining process, and isn't always retrievable from every mining attempt.
